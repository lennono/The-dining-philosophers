The Dining Philosoiphers Problem

* 5 philosophers for hard problems
* Philosophers only think & eat
* Dining table has five plates & five forks*
* Each plate is endlessly refilled.
* Thinkers arenâ€™t dextrous & need 2 forks to eat
* Philosopher may only pick up the forks immediately to his left right.


This model is making use of Semaphores to restrict access to the forks.

Thinking is not a critical section
